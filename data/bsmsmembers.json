I am interested in theoretical aspects of Machine Learning, and Causal Inference. I have mainly worked in the realm of Trustworthy and Reliable ML. By doing so, I wish to motivate the use of causally-aware models for informed inference while preserving model interpretability and accuracy. Apart from this, I am always interested in discussing music and sports!",
