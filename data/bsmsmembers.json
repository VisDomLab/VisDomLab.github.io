        "moreInfo":"My research centers on algorithms for Class Incremental and Continual Learning specifically in audio and video processing. I’m particularly focused on tackling challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and scalability. My goal is to enable models to adapt to new classes over time, without the need to retrain from scratch, all while ensuring they maintain strong performance on tasks that they’ve previously learned.",
